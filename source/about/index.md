I am a father, husband and geek. I've enjoyed coding from a very young age, when my uncle bought me a ZX Spectrum 48k
  when I was only 11! I'm giving my age away there ðŸ˜‰
  
After three years of learning to code, primarily in PHP with HTML, CSS (Bootstrap mostly) and JavaScript, I have finally
  received a job offer for a **Software developer**. With some luck, and Covid-19 restrictions being lifted, I will
  start 6-July-2020.
